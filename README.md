## **Improving efficiency of area under the curve (AUC) estimation in randomized trials through covariate adjustment.**

This repository contains code for:
- Simulation studies comparing AUC estimators (unadjusted, standardized, covariate-adjusted, robust)
- Bootstrap inference for the analysis in the paper

## Files:
For all files, set n to the desired number (we use 200, 500, 700, 1000, 2500, 5000)
- sim.R contains the code for the case with no missing data or measurement error.
- simME.R contains the code for the case measurement error.
- simMiss.R contains the code for the case with missing data on covariates.
